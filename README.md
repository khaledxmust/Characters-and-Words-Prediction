# Characters-and-Words-Prediction
Using LSTM - Recurrent Neural Networks


1. Character Prediction
    1. Extract the Unique Characters
    2. Sorting Unique Characters into indexed Dictionary
    3. Input Sequences ( length = 100 - window size = 1 )
    4. Represinting Sequences as Integers & Encoding Target Character
    5. Simple LSTM Model
    6. Converting back to text & Testing
  
2. Word Prediction
    1. PreProcessing
    2. Simple LSTM Model
    3. Converting back to text & Testing
